# rogueGDX
This is a very simple roguelike that uses LibGDX. For the most part, the code is very generic, although the weapon system is somewhat unique. If the license listed here is too restrictive please contact me at riesx109@umn.edu and we'll work something out; I just like to promote sharing. 

This project was originally called Jay, and I'm frankly terrified of Gradle, so I didn't want to change the same in case that broke everything; this is responsible for the somewhat unusual folder names. 

Dependencies: 

LibGDX

Android SDK if you want the Android part

Known issues:

"Android screens" are designed to use only buttons, but the buttons appear to be misplaced in my android simulator. 

Have to swap in code between screen types.
